# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview:
This project performs a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries. The goal is to uncover insights about the factors that influenced the survival of passengers during the Titanic disaster.

## Objectives:
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
- Visualize data insights using plots.

## Dataset:
The Titanic dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset).

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Numpy**: Numerical operations.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization.

## Key Insights:
- **Gender**: Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males.
- **Class**: First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Age**: Younger passengers had a higher survival rate.

## How to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SunnyBibyan/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA.git
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
